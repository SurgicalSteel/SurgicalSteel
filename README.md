### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Yuwono Bangun Nagoro (a.k.a SurgicalSteel). My friends call me 'Bangun'. ([He/Him](https://www.mypronouns.org/he-him))  

I'm currently working as a software engineer (backend) in Indonesia. My tech stacks are Go and Java.  
I like to write code more than medium post. So, I do not have any medium post.  
I'm currently learning Flutter for app development and Unity for game development.  
In my spare time, I try to learn what I mentioned above, or just solving programming problems on [kattis.com](https://open.kattis.com/).  

You can reach me out by sending an [e-mail](mailto:bangunnagoro@gmail.com).  
And here is [my resume](https://github.com/SurgicalSteel/SurgicalSteel/blob/main/Resume%20Yuwono%20Bangun%20Nagoro%20November%202020.pdf)
