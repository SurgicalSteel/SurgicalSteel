### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Yuwono Bangun Nagoro ([He/Him](https://www.mypronouns.org/he-him)) (a.k.a SurgicalSteel). My friends call me 'Bangun'. You can also call me 'Yuwono' if you do not know the exact pronounciation of 'Bangun', and that's okay though.  

I'm a back-end software engineer in Indonesia with 7 years of experience in Indonesian Start up companies (Tokopedia, Airy, Lemonilo, and Astro)  
My tech stacks are Go, Java, C# .NET, and (a little bit of) Scala.  
I've worked with several technologies at work, such as PostgreSQL, Redis, GCP, Kubernetes, MongoDB, Elastic Search, NSQ, Docker, Ubuntu, etc.  
I like to write code more than medium post. So, I do not have any medium post.  
I'm currently learning Flutter for app development and programming in Scala.  
In my spare time, I try to learn what I mentioned above, or just solving programming problems on [kattis.com](https://open.kattis.com/).  

You can reach me out by sending an [e-mail](mailto:bangunnagoro@outlook.com).  
And here is [my rÃ©sumÃ©](https://github.com/SurgicalSteel/SurgicalSteel/blob/main/Resume%20Yuwono%20Bangun%20Nagoro%20-%20June%202024.pdf).
